      <h2>My Tech Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Just last year, if you had told me I’d be on a tech journey, I would’ve laughed and walked away. I had zero interest — not even a little curiosity. 😂 But life had plans for me, and here I am… fully in!
        <br><br>
        It all started with a 3-month free cybersecurity class organized by Multi Life Savers. I joined, unsure of what to expect, but I quickly fell in love with how powerful and eye-opening the tech space could be. That one decision opened so many doors.
        <br><br>
        Through the same Multi Life Savers organization, I got the chance of a lifetime — a scholarship from Genesys Tech Hub to study Web Development! I was in awe. Me? In tech? But yes, it was happening, and I embraced it wholeheartedly.
        <br><br>
        Along the way, I explored more. I joined HGSCsquare and dived into Digital Marketing and Community Management. I didn’t just learn — I excelled. I emerged as the <strong>best student in Digital Marketing</strong>, and it gave me the confidence to keep going.
        <br><br>
        Now, I’m currently focused on the Genesys Web Development Scholarship. I’m a pure beginner — I mean, totally fresh 😂 — but I’m learning. I’m showing up. And I’m doing my best every single day.
        <br><br>
        So yeah, this is me — Onyinyechukwu Prisca. Welcome to my tech world! I’m so glad I chose this path. It hasn’t been easy, but it’s been worth it. And this is only the beginning 💖
